# A WIP ToDO App

## Overview
This ToDo app will allow you to register with the app. When you register, the email that you used during registration will have a 6 digit code sent out said email. Once we have confirmed that the code works, you're all set up! We put your encrytpted data into the remote server and now your able to login and continue where you left off at any point!

## Current Features:
The current features are incredibly limited as of now since the project is still WIP, however I'll keep the repository updated as more things features come to life for now this is all you're able to do.
 
 * Register
 * Login Screen (Still broken as of now)
 * And you get to stare at a very boring blank screen.
 
 ## Features that are planned to come out:
 Now that have communicated what there is that you're able to do with the app, let's see what you can expect to come in as time goes along.
  * Working login 
  * The actual ToDo part of the ToDo app
  * Login features with other services (ex. login in with google)
  * cloud saves so that you are able to access across different platforms 
  
  These are just some of the features to come, if you have any features that you will like to add, feel more than free to suggest them. 
  
 ## How long realistically speaking is this going to take?
 That's a great question, I am currently trying to juggle a bunch of different aspects such as school, work and socializing, so to be completely honest, this might take a while, but that doesn't mean I am not working on the app everyday. I am working on it practically everyday so hopefully the features come in much quicker now.
